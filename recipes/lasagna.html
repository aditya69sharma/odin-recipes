    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Lasagna, pasta dish of Italian origin, made with broad often ruffled noodles and a tomato or white sauce.</p>
    <p>Lasagna, in the singular, is a southern Italian variation of what northern Italians call lasagne, in the plural. The name is believed to come from a Latin word for cooking pot, lasanum, though some etymologies trace it to the Greek flatbread called laganon, known in Italy since at least the time of Augustus Caesar (63 BCE-14 CE).</p>
    <p>Lasagna in its modern form, made of a meat sauce much like ragù Bolognese that is layered with noodles and béchamel (besciamella or balsamella) sauce, is believed to have originated in the province of Emilia-Romagna.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>MEAT: This super meaty lasagna has sweet italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>ONION & GARLIC: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>TOMATO PRODUCTS: A can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li>SUGAR: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>SPICES & SEASONING: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>LASAGNA NOODLES: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li>EGG: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
